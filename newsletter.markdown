**Learn how to create software that delivers real business value.**

I write about:

- Creating software that's easy to change.
- Understanding the problem domain and the business value of the systems we build.
- Building great teams and constantly improving the way they work.
- Embracing and dealing with real world's complexity.
- Distilling common product development practices down to the basic building blocks and first principles.
