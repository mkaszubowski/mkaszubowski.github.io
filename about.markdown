I'm Maciej Kaszubowski and I'm a software engineer. I specialize in backend
development with big focus on **Domain Driven Design**, **modular software design**,
**Elixir/OTP ecosystem**, and distributed systems.

I believe in holistic approach to problem solving and software development.
My job and my goal is to build amazing products and that requires a great team which takes
ownership and is not afraid of stepping out of their comfort zone. I draw a lot
of inspiration from **Systems Thinking** and **Complexity Theory**.

# How can I help you?

**My mission is to help people build businesses based on software.** I write and
talk about things like:

- Creating software that can react to the changes in the business
- Understanding the problem domain and the business value of the systems we build
- Building great teams and constantly improving the way they work
- Navigating the complexity involved in creating great products
- Distilling common product development practices down to the basic building blocks and first principles
